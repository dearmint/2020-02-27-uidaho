  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  #This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  #including program design, version control, data management,
  #and task automation.
  #Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  #and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  This introductory course will showcase reproducible research through 
  simple analysis examples. The goal is to teach novice programmers to 
  write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis. 
  This 2-day hands-on short course will give participants a strong 
  foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for 
  scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, 
  task automation, and encapsulation. Note that this workshop will 
  focus on teaching basic programming in R, and will not teach 
  statistical analysis. No prior knowledge of R or RStudio is needed.
